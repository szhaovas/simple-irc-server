We added and commented our test cases in `sircs-tester.rb`. Please refer to this file for descriptions of our test cases.

Please see `readme.md` for a list of known issues.

Due to time pressure we do not have enough test cases to cover every possible code path, and we did not stress-test our server with large numbers of clients and channels.
